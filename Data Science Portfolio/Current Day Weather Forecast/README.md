<h3 align="center">Current Day Weather Forecast</h3>


<p align="justify">This project was the opportunity to create a Python based user interactive application to present the Current Days weather forecast for the users based on the zip code or the location in the form of City / City, State / City, State, Country. This was the very interesting opportunity when initially starting the journey in the field of Data Science.</p>

<p align="justify">It involved taking the learnings of Python and various aspects, like technical approach of building the solution, interacting with APIs from external sites to retrieve the required information, formatting the response and handling the potentially unexpected situations to make it a seamless user experience.</p>

<br/>

<p>Project includes call to Open Weather Map API and display below weather elements for the Current Day:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Current Temperature</li>
  <li>Current Day's High Temperature</li>
  <li>Current Day's Low Temperature</li>
  <li>Current Air Pressure</li>
  <li>Current Humidity</li>
  <li>Weather description</li>
</ul>
