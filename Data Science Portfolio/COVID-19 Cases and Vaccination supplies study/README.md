<p align="justify">This project served as a great opportunity to learn about the Data Preparation / Data Wrangling and Analytics activities as a part of the Data Science project life cycle. The techniques like Discovering / Understanding the data, Web-scrapping, Cleaning and Enriching, Subsetting / Structuring / Formatting, Validating and Visualizing aspects.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project, I looked at the various statistics in terms of COVID-19 cases world-wide as well within USA and different states. Additionally, performed analysis of the vaccine supplies to various states with USA in comparison with the case counts. This helped understand that the impact of COVID-19 cases was one of the major driving factors in distributing the vaccine supplies appropriately to the states.</p>
