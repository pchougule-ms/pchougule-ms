<p align="justify">With the in-demand housing market and increasing prices, Real estate / Housing prices topic had gotten my interest. Along with external financial market conditions in a country, various factors contribute to the sale prices of houses / residential properties like size of property, living area, the localities / neighborhood, age of property, number of rooms, building quality to name a few.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project work, I aimed to perform an in-depth Exploration Data Analysis (EDA) using R and to build a possible model to be able to predict the prices based on various factors and get as much closer as possible in terms of predictive power. This model, in turn, would help the customers in determining what would be the fair price to pay for a given house and plan their finances and help save money with close to accurate price predictions.</p>
