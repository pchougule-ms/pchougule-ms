<p align="justify">Global Superstore company offers and sells variety of products throughout the year. They need to keep up with the customer demands in terms of the quality and quantity of the products. At the same time, optimal amount of inventory needs to be maintained to keep up with all the delivery timelines. It also needs to be maintain adequate staff to serve all the customer needs, both in store and online demands. Hence, in order to fulfil the customer needs, it would be ideal to predict / know what the demand forecast looks like. This can be achieved by accurately predicting the Sales estimates for the products in near future, which in turn can help determine the optimal levels of product inventory to be maintained.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project, we are looking to help the global superstore with the US sales forecast for the upcoming / rolling 10 days, based on the sales data available for the years 2015 â€“ 2018 based on Order dates. This will help them keep up with the customer demands, appropriate level of inventory maintenance, manage appropriate number of support staff and be prepared with the delivery arrangements.</p>
