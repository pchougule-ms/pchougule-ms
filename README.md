# About:

<h2 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br> My name is Pushkar </h2>

<p align="center"> I am an IT professional with over 15 years of experience in Application development and maintenance. I have experience working in **Finance** and **Healthcare** domains with the best in class organizations in these respective fields. Finance domain experience spans across merchant payments, acquisitions, credit cards and platform improvements. Healthcare domain experience delas with Claims payments, fraud detection and financial recoveries.

I am also an aspiring Data Scientist - currently pursuing Master of Science in Data Science degree at the the Bellevue University with expected completion in March'2022. I believe every day brings new learning opportunities to us and we need to keep an open eye on what might present itself to us. Continued Learning is the way that can help us continue to improve and can eventually lead us towards excellence. And that's the way I look forward to every day in the life.

I have completed DevOps Foundation certification. As a part of Enterprise DevOps initiative, I am currently leading DevOps progression efforts for my current team in terms of establishing fully automated validations and deployments CI/CD pipelines. This effort will help deliver the quality products to the market with an improved pace. I am also involved in team building / colleague engagements activities for the current working group, to help organize virtual events.
